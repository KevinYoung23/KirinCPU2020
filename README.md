### **Specification**

An efficient CPU implementation is optimised to solve commonly occurring computing problems. Features must be chosen carefully to achieve the best performance in the greatest number of applications for the smallest number of transistors.

Design a CPU with an ISA that is optimised to execute the following algorithms efficiently. Describe the CPU using block schematics and Verilog modules, and simulate using Quartus Prime. You will need to implement the benchmark algorithms in the machine code for your ISA.

You may assume that the **CPU word length (and the C++ int variables used below) are all 16 bits**. Your CPU should **implement enough memory for at least 2K words of instructions and 2K words of data**. Your CPU may use separate instruction and data memory units, or one combined memory unit.

#### **âœ… Task 1: *Calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion***

This benchmark requires a ***stack*** to keep track of all the nested intermediate data values in a (very inefficient) recursive implementation of the fib() function. Alternative implementations that donâ€™t require a stack are not permitted. The stack is a history of all the functions the CPU is currently executing, so that when it finishes a function it can return to where it left off, including all the local variables that were being used. You could implement the stack with custom hardware or using normal data memory, designing appropriate instructions in your ISA.

*Code example:* 		

`int fib(const int n){` 

`int y;`

`if (n<=1) y = 1;`

`else`

`y = fib(n-1);`

`y = y + fib(n-2);`

`return y;}`  --> ***see Fibonacci.cpp in code file***

A typical use of the benchmark would be **fib(5)**.



#### ðŸ’¡Task 1 Approach

##### âœ¨Highlight in this Designï¼š

Rather than performing a recursive loop to calculate a fibonacci number which has an **exponential increasing rate of execution time**, in our design, we choose to use a **linear increasing rate** so that it takes less time to perform fibonacci calculation. Another improvement of this design is besides stacking the memory, it can also read from the previous history if the given input number is  already calculated from the calculation before.



**ISA: **

It keeps the MU0 ISA so that each instruction is composed of **4 bit opcode + 1 bit random + 11 bit oprand**.



**Instruction Set:**

This is used to help write the decoder verilog file which 0 illustrates port is in use and 1 means not in use.
